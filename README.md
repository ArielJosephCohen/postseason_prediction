# Goals of this Project

Welcome to my project! The goal of this project is to use real NBA data and player statistics to see a model can be constructed that would actually predict whether a team or player might earn a trip into the NBA playoffs. I am really interested in seeing if there are any trends inn the modern basketball landscape that are common among successful teams that do not have historical significance. I hope to learn that and a lot more through my investigation

# Business Use

From an individual perspective, there is not as much of an application. For teams, however, having insights on some measures of success, like making the playoffs, can be very valuable.
